    <h1>logic-based Hunger Games simulator</h1>
    <h3>inspired by the <a href="http://brantsteele.net/hungergames/reaping.php" target="_blank">Brantsteele Hunger Games simulator</a>.</h3>
    <p>The reason I made this was because this simulator really doesn't base very much off of what happens other than deaths. You'll notice characters bonding together, then the next day "tracking them down" and killing them, or hurting their leg, leading to nothing.</p>
    <p>This version is made so that almost every event has an effect on what happens next.</p>
