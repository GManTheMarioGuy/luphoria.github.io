The world's first mods on the online game Rockbasher! ^^

With a god mode mod, and a custom level implementer (as in custom values for levels like 100x100 instead of 64x64, extra time, etc..).

Custom Level IDs:

#1: BasicEmpty
#2: CustomLevel
#3: ModdedItems

If you mistype an ID or enter one that does not exist, it will not alert you with a message (usually "press K to load new map").
